            <br />
            Welcome to the official PokeJam game, where you get to play basetball against any Pokemon of your choice!
            <br />
           
            <br />
            Single Match: Choose any Pokemon from our drop down list, and then select heads or tails. The winner of heads or tails makes the first move.
            As a player you can choose to shoot a three-pointer, mid-range shot, or you can lay-up/dunk. You can also attempt to steal or block
            your opponent's shot. The game ends after you and the Pokemon have played 4 quaters. The player with the most points wins!
            <br />
            <br />
            Tournament: You start the game at Tier 1, you select a Pokemon from our drop down list, and then select heads or tails.
            The winner of heads or tails makes the first move. As a player you can choose to shoot a three-pointer, mid-range shot, or
            you can lay-up/dunk. You can also attempt to steal or block your opponent's shot. If you win you move onto Tier 2, and you will repeat this upto Tier 5. The Pokemon
            get better as you move through the Tiers. Become the PokeJam Champion after winning in Tier 5!
